# Email Notification System - Implementation Summary

## 🚀 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive email notification system that automatically sends professional HTML emails to clients when their application status is updated by the admin.

## ✅ What We Built

- ✅ Added `status` column to `applications` table with values: `pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `completed`
- ✅ Updated Application model in `models.py` to include status field

### 2. **Backend Email System** (`backend/routes/applications.py`)
- ✅ **Status Update Endpoint**: `PUT /applications/<id>/status`
  - Admin-only access with JWT authentication
  - Validates status values (pending, accepted, rejected, completed)
